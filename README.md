I'm Carson Decker, a computer science student with a passion for programming and learning about it.

I primarily code in:
- Python
- Java
- Javascript
- Go

Notable Projects:
- [Tetris Remake](https://github.com/carsondecker/Tetris-Remake-Python), a modern version of Tetris in Python. It has many modern Tetris features, such as the hold piece, the super rotation system, the 7 bag randomizer, and even versus functionality.
- [Tic-Tac-Toe](github.com/carsondecker/odin-tic-tac-toe), a tic-tac-toe game made in HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the Odin Project, a self-paced web development course. You can try it (here)[https://carsondecker.github.io/odin-tic-tac-toe/].

I'm currently working on expanding my portfolio of projects to get more experience in programming. I'm also working to improve my knowledge of algorithms and data structures to improve the efficiency of my solutions. Lately, I've been interested in machine learning and data science as well.
